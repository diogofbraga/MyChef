# MyChef
Project for Software Engineering class.

This project was carried out in the second semester of the third year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2018-2019]

The main purpose of the project was to develop a software product, going through the various stages, more precisely the fundamentals, the specification and finally the construction.

The end result is a site that gently guides its users when it comes to cooking, describing each step individually and giving useful information about each situation.

This project was developed by me and my colleagues, respectively:
